# DDS - Drone Deterrence System
## Senior Design Project - Stevens Institute of Technology


### Abstract (Placeholder based on [current website](https://sites.google.com/view/dronedeterrencesystem/home))
In the coming years the prevalence of commercial and consumer drones in residential airspace is expected to increase immensely. The availability and agility of even consumer grade drones pose a threat to the privacy of all citizens, being that they could easily be used to monitor an unsuspecting person. Our system will combine functionality of audio, image, and signal classification to detect the presence of a drone. Furthermore, our system will deter snooping drones, preventing the breach of a citizens privacy. The deterrence may be capturing the drones video signal, determining the location of the drone's operator, gathering identifying information about the drone, or issuing commands to the drone.

### Basic System Model
**Can insert physical representation, updated submodule layout with description, and realized design once we get to that point**
